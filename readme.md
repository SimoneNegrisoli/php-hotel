# PHP Hotel

Print the data on the page, without worrying about the style and push with this result.

Only then add Bootstrap and display the information within a table.

It is not necessary to break up the exercise with partials but if you can do it, so much the better

### Bonuses:

1 - Add a form at the top of the page which, via a GET request, allows you to filter the hotels that have parking.

2 - Add a second field to the form that allows you to filter the hotels by rating (e.g. I enter 3 and I get all the hotels that have a rating of three stars or higher)

**NOTE** _it must be possible to use both filters at the same time (e.g. obtain a list with hotels that have parking and have a rating of three stars or higher)_
_If no filter is specified, display all hotels as before._
